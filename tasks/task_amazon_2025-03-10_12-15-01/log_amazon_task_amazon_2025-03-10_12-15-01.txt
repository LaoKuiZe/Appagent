This function is usually callable when you see a keyboard \nshowing in the lower half of the screen.\n\n3. long_press(element: int)\nThis function is used to long press an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\n\"element\" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\nA simple use case can be long_press(5), which long presses the UI element labeled with the number 5.\n\n4. swipe(element: int, direction: str, dist: str)\nThis function is used to swipe an UI element shown on the smartphone screen, usually a scroll view or a slide bar.\n\"element\" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen. \"direction\" is a string that \nrepresents one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. \"direction\" must be wrapped with double quotation \nmarks. \"dist\" determines the distance of the swipe and can be one of the three options: short, medium, long. You should \nchoose the appropriate distance option according to your need.\nA simple use case can be swipe(21, \"up\", \"medium\"), which swipes up the UI element labeled with the number 21 for a \nmedium distance.\n\n5. grid()\nYou should call this function when you find the element you want to interact with is not labeled with a numeric tag and \nother elements with numeric tags cannot help with the task. The function will bring up a grid overlay to divide the \nsmartphone screen into small areas and this will give you more freedom to choose any part of the screen to tap, long \npress, or swipe.\n\n            You also have access to the following documentations that describes the functionalities of UI \n            elements you can interact on the screen. These docs are crucial for you to determine the target of your \n            next action. You should always prioritize these documented elements for interaction:Documentation of UI element labeled with the numeric tag '2':\nThis UI element is clickable. Tapping the UI element opens the search bar, allowing the user to enter a query or choose a recent search for browsing products.\n\nDocumentation of UI element labeled with the numeric tag '17':\nThis element can be swiped directly without tapping. You can swipe vertically on this UI element. Swiping this area changes the displayed content to reveal more product options or details available within the app.\n\nDocumentation of UI element labeled with the numeric tag '42':\nThis UI element is clickable. Tapping the UI element will take the user to the home page of the app.\n\n\nThe task you need to complete is to find Camping equipment.
