The \nnumeric tag of each interactive element is located in the center of the element.\n\nYou can call the following functions to control the smartphone:\n\n1. tap(element: int)\nThis function is used to tap an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\n\"element\" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\nA simple use case can be tap(5), which taps the UI element labeled with the number 5.\n\n2. text(text_input: str)\nThis function is used to insert text input in an input field/box. text_input is the string you want to insert and must \nbe wrapped with double quotation marks. A simple use case can be text(\"Hello, world!\"), which inserts the string \n\"Hello, world!\" into the input area on the smartphone screen. This function is usually callable when you see a keyboard \nshowing in the lower half of the screen.\n\n3. long_press(element: int)\nThis function is used to long press an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\n\"element\" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.\nA simple use case can be long_press(5), which long presses the UI element labeled with the number 5.\n\n4. swipe(element: int, direction: str, dist: str)\nThis function is used to swipe an UI element shown on the smartphone screen, usually a scroll view or a slide bar.\n\"element\" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen. \"direction\" is a string that \nrepresents one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. \"direction\" must be wrapped with double quotation \nmarks. \"dist\" determines the distance of the swipe and can be one of the three options: short, medium, long. You should \nchoose the appropriate distance option according to your need.\nA simple use case can be swipe(21, \"up\", \"medium\"), which swipes up the UI element labeled with the number 21 for a \nmedium distance.\n\n5. grid()\nYou should call this function when you find the element you want to interact with is not labeled with a numeric tag and \nother elements with numeric tags cannot help with the task. The function will bring up a grid overlay to divide the \nsmartphone screen into small areas and this will give you more freedom to choose any part of the screen to tap, long \npress, or swipe.\n\n            You also have access to the following documentations that describes the functionalities of UI \n            elements you can interact on the screen.

Tapping this UI element will allow the user to type a query or search for items within the app. It serves as an input field for initiating searches related to products or information.\n\nDocumentation of UI element labeled with the numeric tag '10':\nThis element can be swiped directly without tapping. You can swipe vertically on this UI element. Swiping this area up allows the user to proceed to the checkout process with the selected items.\n\nDocumentation of UI element labeled with the numeric tag '30':\nThis UI element is clickable.
